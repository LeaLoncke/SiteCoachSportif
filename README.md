# Site for a sports coach

It is a work to do for my training.

It's a web site for a home sports coach, and he has demands that I must respect:

1. A web site modern and responsive with the help of Bootstrap 4
2. He must have validate my wireframes before I can start coding
3. I have to respect the colors he has chosen (#293540, #7cbce2, #e1ebf5, #ffffff, #fc561f)
4. He wants four pages: home, about, prices and contact


For the home page, he wants a slider just for a desktop version

For the contact page, he wants a form for contact him, a map and an interactive calendar

PS: Sorry if my english is bad.
